### enable this one if youre prepared to mess around with aptitude...
### deb http://gr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ groovy-proposed main restricted universe multiverse 


### extras needed for env. if you rerun setup.sh for a second time delete these underneath...
### after deletion run restore_groovy_sources.sh PRIOR to running setup.sh for a second time...
### if you are on ubuntu groovy at least... otherwise it is a must to mod the repos to your own distro...
### to avoid getting double repos as well as repos which are not meant for your distro... 
### for setup.sh it doesnt matter as long as you run any type of ubuntu being at least focal 20.04 and up.
### restoration will NOT alter any of the repos added through PPA. 
### initial backup of original sources will be made and found here named "backup.sources.list" once sources list restoration has been used once.
### will script another time when not lazy. maybe...
